1. This assignment is to create a public/private messaging program which accepts
   connections from both participants and observers. The participants will
   associate with a username, and are responsible for sending user input to the
   server. The observers pair with participants, and display output from the
   server. Participants may send public messages, which will broadcast to all
   observers, or private messages, which broadcast only to a single
   participant's paired observer. Participants and observers may connect or
   disconnect at any time.

2. The protocol seems all good (for now).

3. I anticipate having some challenges using select, since that was quite
   difficult to wrap my head around in program 2, though hopefully I will have
   learned enough by now to avoid most of the headache. I do think implementing
   the timing constraints on providing usernames to the server will be tricky,
   because we didn't do much of that in the last program. Otherwise, the only
   other aspect which I think will be difficult will be differentiating between
   public and private messages, and treating them appropriately.

4. The man pages, the internet, and Brian Hutchinson.
